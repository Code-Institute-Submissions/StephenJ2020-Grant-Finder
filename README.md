# Project Description   
**Code Institute: Backend Development Milestone Project**  
  
The Milestone 3 project assignment is to  build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. I have the option to choose from one of the  following three scenarios or to come up with my own idea:  
. Create an online cookbook    
. Create a jargon glossary/dictionary for a particular domain   
. Build a book review and recommendation site. 
   
I have decided to create a website called Grant Finder which will act as a portal for users to upload details of Grant opportunities that are available.  The user will have to register in order to be able to upload a Grant and they will need to specify if they are registering as an individual, on behalf of a voluntary/community group or as a representive of the awarding grants body.  The site will contain several categories of grants such as Community Development, Community Events, Festival Grants, Sports etc.  For the scope of the project the site will focus on North Kildare, however I have chosen to keep the site name quite general as this leaves room to scale the site at a future date.  For example the site could be sacled to National coverage with an additional layout of categories to allow filtering by county.

# Project Requirements

## Main Technologies
. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB

. Additional libraries and external APIs

## Mandatory Requirements
  
1. Data handling: Build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. If you are considering using a different database, please discuss that with your mentor first and inform Student Care.
2. Database structure: Put some effort into designing a database structure well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the nesting relationships between records of different entities.
3. User functionality: Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records (CRUD functionality).
4. Use of technologies: Use HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
5. Structure: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Materialize or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
6. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
7. Version control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
8. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via 9.comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
9. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
10. Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository.

# UX Design    
 
## Strategy     
   
### User Stories:

   2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see a summary of the most recent content without having to register.  
   3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to register without having to give too much personal information.  
   4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to filter Categories of Grants.  
   5. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to search for a grant by keywords.  
   6. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know the Issuing body of the grant.  
   7. As a First Time Visitor, I want information about the application process.  
   8. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know the application opening and closing dates.  
   9. As a First Time Visitor, I want a link to the application form/portal.   
   10. As a First Time Visitor, I want a link to any supporting documentation / guidelines provided by the issuing body.  
   11. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to upload details of a grant for other user to apply for.  
   12. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to contact the site owner for basic support if I have any queries about the site.   
 
   - #### Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals
 
   1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log in easily.  
   2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see a list of all the grants that I have uploaded in my User Profile when I log-in. 
   3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to update / amend details of grants that I have uploaded.   
   4. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to delete grants that I have uploaded.  

   - #### Site Owner Goals   
   1. As the site owner, I want to promote a collaborative environment for the sharing of information regarding Grant opportunities for local community groups, clubs & projects.  
   2. As the site owner, I want to be able to edit or remove content uploaded by other users.

## Visual Design   
My colour palette was heavily by the codepen template that I have adapted as the base for my [site layout](https://codepen.io/rinaw/pen/pGxorQ).   
I inputted the colours into the [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/384364-ffd2b0-f6f7eb-cccccc-333333) colour palette generate to check that I was happy with them and I used Google Dev Tools to check the colour contrast worked with white and black text.

In order to test my colour palette prior to starting to code I've created a partial mock-up of my wireframe for the  
the desktop view and I'm satisfied it works.
